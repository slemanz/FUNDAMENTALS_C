# 1. State Machines

**State machines:** an algorithm that can be in one of a small number of states.

**State:** a condition that causes a prescribed relationship of inputs to outputs,
and of inputs to next states.

**Finite State Machine:** an algorithm that can be in finite number of states.

**Combitional System:** current input values are sufficient to determine output.

**Sequential System:** requires additional information about sequence of input changes.
