# 8. Queue

A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in
a specific order. It follows the principle of "First in, First out" (FIFO), where the first element added
to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Can be classified into 4 types:

1. Circular queue
2. Deque
3. Priority Queue
4. Multiple Queue
